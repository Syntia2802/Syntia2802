## Hi!!! How are you? 
I'm a very organised person. During my microbiology studies I solved biological problems and I paid attention to details. Working in the student council taught me teamwork and communication. I'm an open-minded and creative person. I'm interested in Software Engineering and keen on learning new things. I learned programming skills, by myself from books and tutorials
